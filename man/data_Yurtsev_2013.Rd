\title{Data from Yurtsev et al. (2013): \emph{E. coli} cheating of resistance to
beta-lactam antibiotics}
\format{
\code{data_Yurtsev_2013} is a data frame with 2304 rows and 8 columns:
\describe{
\item{ampicillin}{Antibiotic concentration in micrograms per mL}
\item{dilution}{The amount by which the culture was diluted}
\item{culture_id}{Provided for convenience, but \strong{not unique}, use ampicillin concentrations and replicate to identify cultures uniquely}
\item{replicate}{Integer to indicate from which experiment the data came from}
\item{OD_initial}{Initial population density (measured in units of optical density), population density at beginning of growth cycle measurement corrected for non-linear effects and background}
\item{OD_final}{Final population density (measured in units of optical density), population density at end of growth cycle measurement corrected for non-linear effects and background}
\item{fraction_resistant_initial}{Initial fraction of resistant cells (measured using flow cytometry), fraction of resistant cells at the beginning of the growth cycle}
\item{fraction_resistant_final}{Final fraction of resistant cells (measured using flow cytometry), fraction of resistant cells at end of growth cycle}

}
\description{
This data set describes the growth of bacterial populations over a single
cycle in a variety of environments (different ampicillin concentrations)
from a variety of initial starting conditions (changing both the total
initial cell density and the relative abundance of resistant and sensitive
bacteria).
