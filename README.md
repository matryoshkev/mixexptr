# mixexptr

## Overview

mixexptr is an R package for analyzing microbial interactions in mix 
experiments. 

A common experimental design for measuring microbial interactions is to mix together two different microbes (different genotypes, for example) and measure how their behavior and reproductive success depends on mix frequency. How do they perform together compared to performing separately?
