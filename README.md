# mixexptr

mixexptr is an R package for analyzing microbial interactions in mix
experiments.

A common experimental design is to mix together two different microbes
(different genotypes, for example) at several frequencies then measure
how their fitness depends on how common each microbe is. How do they
perform together compared to performing separately? mixexptr provides
tools to calculate and visualize fitness measures that help researchers
get the most out of their data and allow quantitative comparisons across
systems.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mixexptr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("matryoshkev/mixexptr")
```

<!--
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:


``` r
library(mixexptr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:


``` r
summary(cars)
#>      speed           dist       
#>  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
#>  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
#>  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
#>  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
#>  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
#>  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

<img src="man/figures/README-pressure-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
