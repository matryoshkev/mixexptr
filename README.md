# mixexptr

## Overview

mixexptr is an R package for analyzing microbial interactions in mix experiments. 

A common experimental design is to mix together two different microbes (different genotypes, for example) at several frequencies then measure how their fitness depends on how common each microbe is. How do they perform together compared to performing separately?
