# mixexptr

mixexptr is an R package for analyzing microbial interactions in mix experiments. 

A common experimental design is to mix together two different microbes (different genotypes, for example) at several frequencies then measure how their fitness depends on how common each microbe is. How do they perform together compared to performing separately? mixexptr provides tools to calculate and visualize fitness measures that help researchers get the most out of their data and allow quantitative comparisons across systems. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of mixexptr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("matryoshkev/mixexptr")
```

<!--
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(mixexptr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
