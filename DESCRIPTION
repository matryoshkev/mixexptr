Description: Tools to analyze microbial interactions in mix experiments,
    which measure how fitness and behavior change with the local frequency of 
    different microbe types. 'mixexptr' provides tools to calculate and 
    visualize fitness measures that help researchers get the most out of their 
    data and quantitatively compare results across systems.
